This project has been developed in Unity 2023.2.20f1.

The project is a barebone example of a First Person escape room in a multiplayer setting, with interaction examples to illustrate the event system and the scene loading system. 
It has 2 puzzle rooms with 3 interaction examples and a last room to exit the demo. 

1. The first room shows a simple key and door puzzle, illustrating the pick-and-drop system and the overall interaction system. The door can only be opened by the player holding the key(cube) placed in the room.
2. The second room shows an example of proximity interaction with a box raising only when a player is closed, and a trigger button interaction to unlock the room’s door.
3. The last room repeats the same trigger button to exit the demo by triggering it.

The demo starts by choosing the player’s networking role as either host (keyboard H) or client (keyboard C). 

## Interaction keys:
Movement - ZQSD / Move Gaze - Mouse / Interact - E / Grab - G / Drop - R
